# Heavily WIP!
# StoryboardEditor
This project is currently under development and is far from being done or even functional! My plans for this project are:
- Create a functioning osu! storyboard editor with GUI and script support
- Scripts are gonna be written in [Lua](https://www.lua.org/)
- GUI is gonna be made using [Raylib](https://www.raylib.com/)

If you are (for some reason) interested in this project, feel free to message me on Discord for more info. Discord handle: `dalibor`.
